# agent_with_habits
This project contain python classes to simulate an Agent Basede System (ABM) in which agents have a way to develop habits based on patterns of sensorimotor behavior. The basis of this work is the Iterant Deformable Sensorimotor Medium described in Egbert &amp; Barandarian (2014) (doi: 10.3389/fnhum.2014.00590)
